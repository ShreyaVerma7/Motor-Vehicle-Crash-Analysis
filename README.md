# Motor Vehicle Collisions Analysis (NYC)

The dataset we plan to implement has been obtained from NYC Open Data. It is a comprehensive dataset with 29 columns and 1.8 million data rows. The link to the dataset is [Motor Vehicle Collisions](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95). 

This [Motor Vehicle Collisions](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95) crash table contains details on the crash event. The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables has every row describing a motor vehicle collision and it contains information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC.

Note - A police report MV104-AN is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage can be checked [here](https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).

Through this project, we would like to answer the following questions with Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization:

* What time slots see the most accidents? Medical Services and the NYPD could be more vigilant at this time.
* Which months see the most number of accidents
* What days see the most number of accidents?
* Which localities are the most accident prone?
* How do the boroughs with the most and least accidents compare?
* Can we observe the zip codes with the most accidents on a map?
* What does the accident density over NY look like?
* What are leading contributors to accidents in accident-prone areas? Also, which of these factors would lead to the most fatal accidents?
* What vehicle types are involved in the maximum number of fatal accidents?
* Which neighborhoods have improved or deteriorated the most?

We hope that such visualizations would help draw inferences that could help reduce the collisions on road.

*This repo was initially generated from a bookdown template available here: https://github.com/jtr13/EDAVtemplate.*
