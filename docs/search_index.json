Other than homicides, the fatal incidents in which NYPD has the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions. An alarming fact is that traffic is the top injury-related cause of death of children in NYC. Thus it is imperative to analyse all the data available on motor vehicle collisions in NYC in order to draw helpful insights to curb the number of fatalities. Through this project, our goal is to answer the following questions with the help of Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization: What time during the day has majority of accidents? Medical Services and the NYPD could be more vigilant at this time. Which localities are most accident-prone? Which areas are most dangerous for pedestrians at night-time? It would be wiser to avoid such areas. What are leading contributors to accidents in accident-prone areas? Also, which of these factors would lead to the most fatal accidents? What vehicle types are involved in the maximum number of fatal accidents? Analyzing data from 2012, was there a drop in the accidents in any area? Clearly, the measures taken to tackle accidents there would have worked and can be extended to other areas in need. We hope that such visualizations would enable us to draw inferences that will help reduce collisions on the road. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Due to success of the CompStat program implemented by NYPD in 1994, they began to apply the CompStat principles to other problems such as traffic collisions. Thus in April 1998 they implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety wherein police officers complete form MV-104AN for all vehicle collisions. The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision. Currently, Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS) enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department’s crime data warehouse which is then published in the NYC OpenData website regularly. All of the data is publicly available. The dataset we plan to implement has been obtained from NYC Open Data and is named ‘Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes’. It is a comprehensive dataset with 29 columns and 1.8 million data rows. The data is in the form of a table which has every row describing a motor vehicle collision and it contains information from all reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. Note - A police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage can be checked too.

When Borough values aren’t available (NA value) then the chances of other information in about the accident being available is also low. 4.2 Missing Value Analysis for Missing Value Patterns plot in all data of vehicles involved in a collision 4.2.1 Missing Pattern Plot Function When considering all of the data, information of the 4th and 5th vehicle is missing maximum number of times because it may not be too frequent to have a 5 or 4 car collision. Therefore, to better understand about the missing values (and the combinations in which they may be frequent) in the data set, we plot the missing value patterns for each of the 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 vehicle collisions. 4.2.2 Missing Value Patterns plot for Vehicles involved in 5 vehicle collisions Majority of the data entries (with 40+ entries) only missed on the Off Street name entry. The second most missed combination of entries are the address related entries i.e. Off Street name, Cross Street name, Zip Code, and Borough. 4.2.3 Missing Value Patterns plot for Vehicles involved in 4 vehicle collisions Majority of the data entries (with 40+ entries) only missed on the Off Street name entry. The second most missed combination of entries are the address related entries i.e. Off Street name, Cross Street name, Zip Code, and Borough. 4.2.4 Missing Value Patterns plot for Vehicles involved in 3 vehicle collisions Majority of the data entries (with 40+ entries) only missed on the Off Street name entry. The second most missed combination of entries are the address related entries i.e. Off Street name, Cross Street name, Zip Code, and Borough. 4.2.5 Missing Value Patterns plot for Vehicles involved in 2 vehicle collisions Since only 2 vehicle is involved in the collision, its documentation has complete case instance too. Even otherwise, majority of the data entries only missed on the Off Street name entry (40+ times). The second most missed combination of entries are the address related entries i.e. Off Street name, Cross Street name, Zip Code, and Borough. 4.2.6 Missing Value Patterns plot for Vehicles involved in 1 vehicle collision Since only 1 vehicle is involved in the collision, its documentation has complete case instance too. Here also, even otherwise, majority of the data entries only missed on the Off Street name entry (40+ times). The second most missed combination of entries are the address related entries i.e. Off Street name, Cross Street name, Zip Code, and Borough. 4.3 Final Inference from above graphs The common inference across all graphs is that 40+ instances of Off Street are not present in any records of the collisions. Further, the second most missed combination of entries are the address related entries i.e. Off Street name, Cross Street name, Zip Code, and Borough also occurs across all types of collisions (based on the number of vehicles involved).
