Other than homicides, the fatal incidents in which NYPD has the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions. An alarming fact is that traffic is the top injury-related cause of death of children in NYC. Thus it is imperative to analyse all the data available on motor vehicle collisions in NYC in order to draw helpful insights to curb the number of fatalities. Through this project, our goal is to answer the following questions with the help of Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization: What time slots see the most accidents? Medical Services and the NYPD could be more vigilant at this time. Which months see the most number of accidents What days see the most number of accidents? Which localities are the most accident prone? How do the boroughs with the most and least accidents compare? Can we observe the zip codes with the most accidents on a map? What does the accident density over NY look like? What are leading contributors to accidents in accident-prone areas? Also, which of these factors would lead to the most fatal accidents? What vehicle types are involved in the maximum number of fatal accidents? Which neighborhoods have improved or deteriorated the most? We hope that such visualizations would enable us to draw inferences that will help reduce collisions on the road. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Motor Vehicle Crash Data 2.2 Geospatial Data", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Motor Vehicle Crash Data Due to success of the CompStat program implemented by NYPD in 1994, they began to apply the CompStat principles to other problems such as traffic collisions. Thus in April 1998 they implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety wherein police officers complete form MV-104AN for all vehicle collisions. The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision. Currently, Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS) enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department’s crime data warehouse which is then published in the NYC OpenData website regularly. All of the data is publicly available. The dataset we plan to implement has been obtained from NYC Open Data and is named ‘Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes’. It is a comprehensive dataset with 29 columns and 1.8 million data rows. The data is in the form of a table which has every row describing a motor vehicle collision and it contains information from all reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. Note - A police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage. Motor Vehicle Collisions Dataset 2.2 Geospatial Data In order to visualize trends using the locations of crashes present in the collision tabluar data amongst boroughs and zipcodes of New York City, we use GEOJSON files which store geospatial data regarding the boundaries of all booroughs and zipcodes. These files are publicly available and have open access. NYC Borough Boundaries NYC Zip Codes "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation We typecasted the date and time columns to the required format. When plotting Borough, Zip Code and Crash time summary statistics, we dropped all instances where the values were not available and grouped by the appropriate variable. Depending on the graph requirements, we took subsets of the data using filtering. When plotting the Choropleth maps, we obtained the geojson data corresponding to NYC Boroughs and Zip Codes, and merged it with our transformed data. The below dataframe represents our datatset with the date and time in appropriate formats and without NA values for the same. ## # A tibble: 6 × 30 ## CRASH.DATE CRASH.TIME BOROUGH ZIP.CODE LATITUDE LONGITUDE LOCATION ON.STREET.NAME CROSS.STREET.NA… OFF.STREET.NAME NUMBER.OF.PERSO… ## &lt;chr&gt;

When Borough values aren’t available (NA value) then the chances of other information in about the accident being available is also low. 4.2 Missing Value Analysis for Missing Value Patterns plot in all data of vehicles involved in a collision 4.2.1 Missing Pattern Plot Function When considering all of the data, information of the 4th and 5th vehicle is missing maximum number of times because it may not be too frequent to have a 5 or 4 car collision. Therefore, to better understand about the missing values (and the combinations in which they may be frequent) in the data set, we plot the missing value patterns for each of the 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 vehicle collisions. 4.2.2 Missing Value Patterns plot for Vehicles involved in 5 vehicle collisions Majority of the data entries (with 40+ entries) only missed on the Off Street name entry.

Also, which of these factors would lead to the most fatal accidents? 5.9 What vehicle types are involved in the maximum number of fatal accidents? 5.10 Which neighborhoods have improved or deteriorated the most?", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 What time slots see the most accidents? Looking at the graph generated above, we observe that the peak hours of the evening and afternoon from 2PM to 8PM (highest being from 4-5PM) see the most accidents. This makes sense since the highest number of cars on the road at these times. An unusual peak occurs at the time slot 12AM to 1AM. Since this is the time most public and recreational spots close, it is possible that the higher number of accidents are observed due to greater traffic. We see the highest proportion of fatal accidents in the later hours of the day. Whilst the number of accidents may be more during the evening, the proportion of them being fatal is much lesser. This could be due to lower visibility, driver intoxication or over-speeding. The police and ambulance services should be highly vigilant at these times to prevent any loss of life. 5.2 Which months see the most number of accidents? July sees the highest number of accidents. This is probably due to higher road traffic on the 4th of July weekend. The month also experiences the most rainfall in New York City which could have led to a greater number of accidents. The highest number of fatal crashes is observed during September. This could be caused by greater road traffic due to nicer weather, schools being back in session, and the Labor Day weekend. Days getting shorter may also be a contributing factor. 5.3 What days see the most number of accidents? Most crashes are observed on 12th September and least on 29th Feb. There is no particular reason for the former being this way. 29th Feb was naturally the day the fewest accidents were observed as the date occurs once every 4 years. 5.4 Which localities are the most accident prone? First, we’d like to see the trend of people killed in Motor Vehicle Crashes over the years (2012- 2021) in Boroughs across New York. Overall, it is apparent that Brooklyn has had the highest number of people killed in crashes among all Boroughs of New York across the years from 2012 to 2021 (except in 2013 and 2018). Queens has come to a close second in the number of people killed across the years from 2012 to 2021 (except in 2016). Furthermore, Staten Island has has the least number of people killed in Motor Vehicle crashes among all Boroughs and across all the given years. Diving into this further, we look at the number of people injured by vehicle crashes in the same time period to confirm if the above analysis still holds. It is clear that Brooklyn has the highest number of people injured by vehicle crashes across all years; it is above 10 thousand injuries every year from 2013-2021. Queens is the second most dangerous area in terms of number of people injured by vehicle crashes with above 10 thousand injuries every year from 2013-2019. Thus, the same trend from above continues with Brooklyn being very unsafe in terms of road safety. Now, let us look into what are the top 20 areas (referenced by Zip Codes) in Brooklyn that have the highest number of fatalities (people killed and people injured). Each of these area codes in Brooklyn have more than 2500 fatalities. These area codes could be having the highest number of accidents thus causing more fatalities. Now, we visualize the impact caused by accidents in each Borough to get an understanding of which Boroughs have been most impacted in terms of number of fatalities, people killed and people innjured. Brooklyn and Queens seem to have the highest number of accidents throughout. In 2013 and 2014, there were maximum number of those hurt in New York and the majority of these last in Brooklyn and Queens - making these regions concerning. It can be noted here though that Brooklyn and Queens seem to have been consistently high number of people killed and injured every year. 5.5 How do the boroughs with the most and least accidents compare? Through the comparison histogram, we evaluate the two boroughs Brooklyn, which sees the most number of accidents, and Staten Island, which sees the least. While the distribution of accident count over the time slots remains similar, the magnitude is vastly different. This is due to the fact that Brooklyn has a much higher population and population density (nearly 5 times the number of people per square mile) 5.6 Can we observe the zip codes with the most accidents on a map? The least accidents have been observed in Zip Code 10055 (in the metro area of Manhattan) and the highest in 11207 (South-East NY-Brooklyn). This could be due to a smaller area asociated with the zip code as well as population densities. 5.7 What does the accident density over NY look like? It is apparent that Brooklyn and Queens have high densities of accidents, however, it is really interesting to see that Manhattan has a trend of increasing density. 5.8 What are leading contributors to accidents in accident-prone areas? Also, which of these factors would lead to the most fatal accidents? The above plot shows the leading contributing factors to fatalities (i.e. people killed and injured). ‘Unspecified’ contributors have the highest occurance; it could involve a hit-and-run case or when the exact reason behind the accident could not be recorded. It is also clear that driver inattention/distraction and the failure to yield right-of-way are the two highest recorded causes of accidents. This often happens when the driver is under the influence or sleepy or the roads look mostly empty. Moving on to the leading contributors in the most accident prone areas, we have the following graph: Here, we observe the division of recorded contributing factors in injuries accidents in different Boroughs. Driver inattention or distraction and the failure to yield right-of-way is the highest cause of accidents in all the Boroughs of New York. These factors are followed by traffic control disregarded and vehicles following too closely. It appears to be that the trend of the highest contributing factors for accidents across all Boroughs is similar. Note - In this graph, we don’t include ‘Unspecified’ as a contributing factor; due to its sheer frequency, the varied scale does not allow us to see the other contributing factors clearly. However, it must be noted that the highest contributing factor is still the ‘Unspecified’. 5.9 What vehicle types are involved in the maximum number of fatal accidents? SUV’s or Station wagons get into the highest number of accidents. Passenger vehicles and sedans form a close second and third respectively to SUV’s or Station wagons. This could be because the most seen vehicles on the roads are also SUV’s and passenger vehicles. We move on to see which of these vehicles cause the highest number of fatalities below. The number of victims of the accidents are highest among accidents involving SUV’s or station wagons. This is closely followed by the number of victims of the accidents caused by sedans and passenger vehicles. Again, this could be due to the fact that there is a maximum occurrence of such vehicles in the areas. We can see that there are some number of fatalities caused by Ambulances. Since this is an emergency vehicle taking the sick to the closest hospitals, we should go deeper and see which vehicles are colliding with Ambulances and why. From the above graph, it is again apparent that the maximum number of accidents involving ambulances are with SUV’s or station wagons. However, we can also see that there were instances of an ambulance crashing with another ambulance. This is interesting because ambulances are exempted from following most road rules. However, if this is leading to more accidents, we should look into this and try to minimize it. 5.10 Which neighborhoods have improved or deteriorated the most? In this graph we have tried to isolate the most improved and deteriorated regions in the time frame (2012-2021) through their zip code. We took a mean across the first 5 years and the next 5 years. The difference was calculated and plotted. The most improved zip code is 10022 and the one which deteriorated the most is 11212. Clearly the former has been successful in implementing ways to curb accidents and the later has not. The reasons for this decrease need to be analyzed carefully and similar policies should be implemented state wide. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion In this project we investigated the trend of accidents and the harm they cause across all the Boroughs of New York City. The analysis of 10 years of Motor Vehicle Crash Analysis data from 2012 to 2021 shows that the number of accidents increase and decrease in phases. The decrease could mean that the former years would have been more successful in implementing ways to curb accidents and the later has not. The reasons for this decrease need to be analyzed carefully and similar policies should be implemented state wide. On looking closer, we see that 2013 has a peak in the number of accidents and it slowly decreases since then upto the year 2015. Our investigation further shows that Brooklyn is the most unsafe in terms of road safety. This could be due to the fact that Brooklyn has a much higher population and population density (nearly 5 times the number of people per square mile). Brooklyn and Queens have the highest number of accdidents, people injured, and people killed in accidents across all of the Boroughs, whereas, Staten Island has the least in all of these respects. We also observed that the peak hours of the evening and afternoon from 2PM to 8PM see the most accidents. This makes sense since the highest number of cars on the road at these times. An unusual peak occurs at the time slot 12AM to 1AM. Since this is the time most public and recreational spots close, it is possible that the higher number of accidents are observed due to greater traffic. It is also noted that October sees the highest number of accidents. This could be due to the Halloween weekend which creates greater road traffic. Additionally, the change to shorter nights during this month causes visibility issues which could lead to more accidents. Further, the highest number of fatal crashes is observed during September. This could be caused by greater road traffic due to nicer weather, schools being back in session, and the Labor Day weekend. Days getting shorter may also be a contributing factor. We also see that 29th Feb was naturally the day the fewest accidents were observed, which is logically accurate, as the date occurs once every 4 years. In terms of the contributing factors leading up to the accident, ‘Unspecified’ contributors have the highest occurance. It could involve a hit-and-run case or when the exact reason behind the accident could not be recorded. It is also clear that driver inattention/distraction and the failure to yield right-of-way are the two highest recorded causes of accidents. This often happens when the driver is under the influence or sleepy or the roads look mostly empty. Also, SUV’s or Station wagons get into the highest number of accidents. Passenger vehicles and sedans form a close second and third respectively to SUV’s or Station wagons. This could be because the most seen vehicles on the roads are also SUV’s and passenger vehicles. One possible extension of our analysis in the future is to investigate connection between the weather conditions (temperature, rainfall) and the accidents in New York, since New York has drastic weather changes. Due to the limited time we could devote to this project, we were unable to explore that direction at this time.
